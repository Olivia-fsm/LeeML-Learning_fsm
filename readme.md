## P1-Introduction
### Supervised v.s. Reinforcement
- Supervised: 
	Given an algorithm, judge the next step.
- Reinforcement Learning:
	- No given algorithms(people cannot figure out)
	- First move-> ...many moves...-> Algorithms by machine itself.-> Win!
- *Example*: AlphaGo == Supervised + reinforcement
